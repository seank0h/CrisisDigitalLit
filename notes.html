    <section id="about"><p>This piece was inspired by the present day global refugee crisis and follows the plight of Syrian refugees fleeing from their country. A country entrenched in civil war with a pre-war population of 22 million:
         13.5million need humanitarian assistance, 6 million internally displaced, and 5 million externally displaced. It is one of the biggest victims of the ongoing violence and indifference, however, Syria is only one of the other countless tragedies: Sudan, Venezeula, Afghanistan, Iraq, Myanmar, etc. The numbers of the current refugee crisis are 65.3 million people. 
         That is affecting every continent on the globe and reportedly surpassing World War II era numbers. 
         <br>
         You are following a family of Syrian Refugees and you must choose their course of escape. Leapfrog from country to country, following realistic routes, and learn how your route fared for the family.
