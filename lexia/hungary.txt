The truck's trailer had no windows. They were incomplete darkness, packed in with dozens of other refugees. The smell of sweat and grime coated the air. Few people spoke, most waiting in silence. Listening for signs of the outside world. It would be a long ride.

Omar made sure to always have contact with Rasha and Khaled. It would be difficult to find each other in the sightless crowd. Still, it was less threatening than facing separation at border patrols. At least they couldn’t be pulled a nation away here. 

In the darkness, there was only the feel of Rasha’s hand clasping his, and the stink in the air. It could have been worse. To reduce the stink of the ride, each of the refugees had been given anti-urination tablets by the smugglers. Omar hoped it wouldn’t cause kidney damage. 

He hoped even more that the truck wouldn’t be investigated by the Hungarians. He didn’t know what the smugglers were claiming the cargo as, but they had boxes fastened by the door, in case anyone decided to check the cargo. And to prevent refugees from changing their mind. 

There were few handholds in the trailer, and sharp turns caused people to slide and shove. It was uncomfortable, but bearable. They had faced worse, they would face worse. 

It would only be a few hours, and then they’d be past Hungary, and past the current danger. Of course, they’d only be moving into some new danger. But thinking too hard of the dangers in the past and the future needed to be avoided, the present was dangerous enough.

Even then, sliding around in the dark was preferable to a Hungarian camp.

There, people spent their eternity in trailers like these.
