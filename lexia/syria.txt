“We can’t stay here.” Four words and conversation still around the worn plastic. The faint rattle of passing protest pulls forward in the silence, rat-tat-tat. Khaled grips his fork tighter. “We can not stay here.” 

“By Allah, my son we can’t just-”

“Father, we can’t stay here.”

Mother begins to pull her seat back from the table, gathering the last of the good silverware into her hands stacked neatly onto four plates. She leaves for the kitchen. Mohammod gathers his cards back into the fraying cardboard box, fingers worrying the edges of each creased card. 

“Did you have a plan, boy?”

“Mohammod,” Snaps father.

“No,” Another bomb rattles into the distance.

“People are going to Egypt. People are going north. Others leave every day, Aya has not been able to go to school in months. The bombs will not stop father. The regime will not stop.”

“They will be judged in the afterlife.”

“And we will join them if we stay here!”

Mother returns from the kitchen reclaim her seat next to her husband. Her still damp work-worn hand kneads the tense line of his arm, fingers trailing down to entwine with his where they rest.

“I fear too my love.”

Mohammod takes a deep breath. “I know some people.”

“From your gambling.”

“From my gambling.”

Mohammod nods slowly. Khaled thinks of the generations of patriarchs who have lived in this city. He thinks of the grandparents killed in the revolution. He thinks of Aya, fiery spirit dwindling in the face of such danger. Thinks of these classmates who no longer respond. Who can no longer respond. 

“Rasha, help me count what we have,” whispers his father. 

Mother nods and pulls back to follow Omar into the other room. Next to him, Mohammod begins to pray. 

“Allah preserve us.”
