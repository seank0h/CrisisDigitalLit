Mohammod had missed dice. 
He tries not to feel bad about it most of the time. The ache comes most often when he and his new family huddle in the backs of rusted trucks or lie pressed flat on the bottom of steel skives. He has found he likes gambling with money and material much more than his life. 
This table is, to a point, safer. Tucked back behind an Austrian dive bar, dingy overhead fluorescent bulbs buzzing covered in griddle grease is nothing when you have been shot at by men in dark wraps filled with hate.  Granted, much like the back rooms and street corners of his youth, there are no rules here. Absolutely nothing is stopping the men across him from taking back their winnings by force. He plays humble. 
Mohammod knows what Omar thinks about his habits. The man barely tries to hide his scowls after all. Much like Omar's opinion on how he raised his daughter, Mohammod finds he does not care. He knows he could doom them with this habit; that he could lose everything to a tin and chance. Mohammod also knows he shouldn't like how that makes the high better. 
But, the five hundred dollars on the table will be enough to pay the smuggler offering to move the group on the next leg of the journey. The man across from him plays the same risk he does, gambling away his family's future for the chance of progress. Omar has let a lot go for his family. 
The dice clink against tin. 
With an exhale smoke seeped past the cheap cigarette between his teeth, Mohammod pulls the winnings toward himself. His eyes never quite meeting the man across the table, instead focussed on the looser's tense fist pressed against jeans. Endiquite, and habit, says he will have to stay for a few more rounds. Play safe, do not lose this.
For once, He has bought her a chance.
