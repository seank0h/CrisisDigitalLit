Omar still couldn't believe that they had reached their destination all those weeks ago. The trek had wound through many countries, but they had reached the ports of Sweden. There they were meant not with extortionate patrols, but guards that were interested in helping them find the nearest shelter. 

They had begun the process of asylum with warm beds and full stomachs. Since then, his family had found more permanent housing, and Khaled had applied to several colleges, seeking to continue his education in legal studies. It was looking like one of them might accept him.

Yet, even now, he could see flames on the horizon, reaching up from another complex. Someone had set it aflame. He could see people like him fleeing the devastation. Ever fleeing, never safe. Some areas faired better than others, but all had their dissidents

Dissidents had ruined his country, and now they sought to ruin his haven. They hated him for what he represented, the toll supporting his family had taken. He would show them.

He would find work in this country. He would learn their language, and find friends willing to accept him. He would find prosperity and inspire hope. And he would help others accomplish the same.

He may be a stranger in a strange land, but that wouldn't be for long. Soon, he would become a better citizen than those who sought his deportation.

He had to.
