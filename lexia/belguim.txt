Omar pulls Rasha and Khaled close. A woman in a white coat is counting. She looks at Omar, Rasha, Khaled, a short woman standing near to them. She speaks into a walkie-talkie. She squints at the short woman. She steps forward and asks “Vous! Vous la! Combien êtes vous?” Omar looks at Khaled, he feels his stomach turn. “Trois! Nous sommes trois!” Khaled shouts back. The woman says something more into the walkie-talkie. She pauses. The walkie-talkie emits static, garbled voice. Khaled strains to listen. The woman unlatches the rope between her and Omar. “Vous trois, venez ici.” Omar looks at Khaled nervously. “Go with her. Quickly!” Khaled says, pushing Rasha along. Omar looks back to see the woman replace the rope, holding a hand up to stop the short woman from following. The woman walks in front at a brisk pace, she does not look back at them. “Parlez-vous français?” She says without turning her head. “Seule- Seulement moi.” Khaled stutters. The woman makes a clicking sound with her tongue. “Anglais?” She asks. “Juste moi.” Khaled replies, struggling to match her pace. Omar pulls on Khaled’s sleeve. “What is happening?” “They found somewhere that will take us.” Khaled replies. “What about the others?” Omar presses. “They do not speak French.” Khaled says, not turning his head.
