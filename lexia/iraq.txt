It had been two weeks since Assad had regained control of Syria.  The war had supposedly ended, but the camps were slow to empty.
Khaled was walking with his mother back to their tent.  They both carried heavy canvas bags filled with food and water.  Each step sent a jolt of pain through Khaled’s feet.  His shoes were too tight on him, but there hadn’t been much choice at the time when his last pair had fallen apart. 
He tried to focus on counting the tents as they passed them.  31, 32, 33…
“Khaled!” 
Khaled stumbled and turned to see his mother stopped a few paces behind him.
“What is it?” He asked, trying not to sound annoyed.  The pain built up in his feet now that he had stopped.
His mother was looking up the street past him.  Khaled turned to see a group of about twenty Iraqi men standing outside one of the tents used by the UN to coordinate supply distribution.  They were starting to surround a truck parked just outside that had been partially unloaded of its tents, blankets and clothes.  A worker stood nervously in the bed of the truck.
“It’s time for them to go home!”  one of the men shouted at someone unseen within the tent.
“Their President said it’s safe again, they can go home now!” 
“Stop letting more of them come here, this is our city!”
Rasha grabbed Khaled’s arm and tugged him towards an alley. 
“Come on, let’s go back this way.” She said.  Khaled followed her quickly.
His head pounded. At one time he might have argued with her, but the scar on his leg kept him quiet. 
The shouts behind them grew louder and louder until suddenly a rifle was heard that deafened everything.  They were lucky, just one shot probably fired into the air.  Sometimes the military police had to kill before they could control the mobs.
“Can we really not go home yet?”  Khaled asked as they neared their tent.
Rasha looked forward as she answered, “No, our home is rubble.  But we can’t stay here either.”
