The three men struggled with the tent while Rasha and Aya watched.  “Are we really going to live in that?”  Aya asked.  She watched her father straighten out one of the canvas panels.  It was a dull yellow, just slightly duller than the sand.  A grey patch ran diagonally across its length, fraying at the edges.
           	“It will be alright.” Rasha reassured her, “We can pick out a few rugs and hang some on the inside.  Tomorrow we can even go to the market and find a table and chairs to put in it.”
           	Aya tilted her head at the tent.  I don’t think it’ll be big enough for that, she thought.  There wasn’t anywhere else to go though.  She turned to look down the “street.”  The tent city stretched on before her and down the sides of the hill that the main city was built on.  Thousands of square tents were laid out in crooked rows.  Most bore the blue UNHCR logo, some more faded than others.  Cooking fires were set up outside, and cloth lines had been strung up between the tents.  People cooked, cleaned, or just milled about.  Trucks laden with supplies drove up and down the aisles.  Aya felt suddenly claustrophobic.  There were too many of them, even the desert didn’t seem large enough to contain them all. 
           	“We won’t be here long.” Rasha continued, “Once we have enough money, we’ll continue to Greece. We’ll live close to the ocean.  Your father will repair cars, and you’ll go to school and learn everything you ever wanted to know about Canada and Justin Berher.”
           	“Bieber, Aunt Rasha, Justin Bieber.” Aya smiled up at the older woman. It would be alright, wouldn’t it?  This was only temporary.   “Actually, I’ve outgrown him.  His music is more for little girls.  I’m much more into Nickelback now.”
