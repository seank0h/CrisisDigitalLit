The sky had started to redden with the setting sun, but the wharf was still crowded and noisy.  Seagulls flocked around fishing trawlers as they unloaded their catches for the day.  Dock workers yelled back and forth across the crowds as they tied up incoming ships. 
Omar fought against the sea of people, straining his head above them to read the names of the shops. The Tranca Fish Market was one of the smaller fish markets on the wharf, but Muhammed had learned during a card game that they were looking for workers. Omar had yet to find a job since they arrived in Tripoli, no one had wanted to hire another Syrian. Muhammed had gotten lucky with his job at a car mechanics, and Khaled was teaching English to other refugees, but Omar had no such luck.
He finally found the open-air market half a kilometer from the main pier. Workers hurried about, pushing carts of dripping fish between sagging wooden tables laden with ice-packed fish.  Omar stopped one as they entered the market. “I heard there was a job opening here?” he asked.
“You can talk to the manager, he’s in the far back.” the man replied.
“Thank you.”  Omar walked to the back of the market.  There weren’t many customers right then, but plenty of workers were busy packing fish into a large, walk-in refrigerator.  Omar spotted a short man with a clipboard.  He looked up as Omar approached.
“Can I help you?” he asked curtly.
“Yes, I was looking for a job.  I heard you were hiring stockers?” 
The man looked over Omar.  Omar’s hair was graying, and his clothes were loose on his thin frame.  He, along with Rasha and Mohammed, had been making sure that their kids were eating first.
“Do you think you can handle it?  You wouldn’t be stocking cereal.”
“Oh, I can handle it, sir.”
“Well then, let’s talk.”
