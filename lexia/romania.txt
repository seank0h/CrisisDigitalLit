It was a hard and mountainous region. A region unkind to the soft and weak, sparse in human life aside from the occasional farmstead. Precisely the reason why the smuggler, Hakim, chose this path through the Balkan states. To move this ragged motley band of refugees undetected through the borders of hostile nations, was impossible otherwise. Mohammad, paused to look across the hinterland unfolding ahead of him: treacherous terrain with jagged rocks jutting out from the ridges, long blades of grass swallowing the crooked dirt path ahead of them, and the bowed heads of the huddled masses pressing onward through harsh winds and wretched silence.

He looked down to his little Aya, plodding along next to him. Her pink backpack had long faded to a tattered shell of itself, more brown than pink, with tears pitting the surface. He choked up at the thought of his wife, may she find peace, seeing Aya broken like this. 

He whispered softly to her "Aya, do you want me to tell you a joke?" 

"Mmm," Aya murmured weakly back, 

"Are you tired," he asked

"Mhmm," she murmured, barely audible.

"Hey Tired, I'm Mohammad," he replied with a chuckle. Noticing the slightest hints of a smile ghosting on her lips, he found himself mirroring her. "Here, as a way to apologize let me give you a piggyback ride," he said, lowering himself to be eye level with her. 

She nodded and crawled on top of his back, nesting her head in between the crook of his neck. He grunted as he stood upright.

"Dad, we will be safe soon right?"

"Of course, little one. I promised you would just have to trust me."

"I promise"
