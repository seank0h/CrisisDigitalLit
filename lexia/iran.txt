He'd forgotten what clean looked like three months ago, but the barn at the end of the cul-de-sac pulled the elusive sense of what it meant to be filthy back from the frayed edge of his memory. Omar could see actual horse shit on the floor, and neither he nor his wife dared ask what else the rickety building was used for. The woman in front ignored the group's visible discomfort at the smell and pushed aside a scarlet tartan wall hanging to reveal a four by four crawlspace chiseled into the limestone.
"You'll be safe here."
Aya clutched her sack under one arm and breathed in. Mohammad placed a hand on her shoulder before ducking and lying flat on the detritus. The dust displaced tickled Omar's nose, but that discomfort was inconsequential compared to the murmur of gunshots from the town center and the screams of discovered Syrian people. They hadn't meant to bring an investigation here, but the smuggler in front of them didn't seem to blame his family. The only hope left was that she was kind enough to forgive an outsider. Kind enough not to sell all of them to Immigration for a month's bread. 
Omar looked to the girls half-hidden behind the barn door, wide-eyed and trembling. He frowned. 
"What about-"
"Hush, do not make a sound, or you will kill us all." 
"But-" With a huff, the woman began to push Mohammod and his family into the hole. Rasha ducked after, tugging Omar where his hand still grasped hers Khaled close behind. The woman gave one last look at their cramped forms then released the tartan back over the hole. 
Black.
