Aya came back from school repeating words to herself as she saw them in English. “Wall, man, woman, child, child, child, dog, tire…” She tells her father that English lessons are fun, and that she only wishes they lasted longer. “There are two teachers. They change every other day. I like Maria more, she tells us stories.” There is a rumble outside the tent. Muhammad pulls away the curtain to see a truck piled high with blankets and mattresses. “Have you come for us?” He asks. The truck driver nods and points to a mattress on the top of the pile. The two men struggle with the object, eventually dragging it inside the tent and letting it fall flat on the floor. Dust rises and slowly floats back down. The truck driver hands Muhammad a two blankets, then pauses to look at Aya. He then takes one of the blankets back and hands him a smaller one. Muhammad is stunned for a moment, opening his mouth to say something, but says nothing as the truck drives further into the city of tents. He closes his mouth, it’s too dry to leave it open. “Come now Aya, out of the heat.” He brings her inside and hands her a glass of water. There is a small pot over a gas flame. It’s filled with chopped potatoes and carrots, it smells like onions. Muhammad smiles at the pot. “I only wish they brought bread!” “Bread!” Aya says in English. “We learned that word today!”
