"This is the boat that we are to take across the Mediterranean? To Lesbos?" Rasha rasped. "This does not even look fit to go fishing off the coast." 

Her opinion of the dinghy was not unfounded, any person with common sense could see that this boat was not fit for shore work, let alone the open ocean. She was furious. She has heard enough of those who failed the crossing and the reasons why. The smugglers lied to them; It did not have enough space for everyone that was gathered here. The boat showed clear signs of aging with scarring across the hull with pockets of rust and wear alongside the exterior. Doubt festered in the minds of everyone gathered in the dock, but what other choice did they have? 

"My love, we have no other choice. This was the person Hassan told us about, and he says he has succeeded  before." Omar squeezed her hand. "Allah willing, I'm sure we will be able to manage." 

Rasha looked up at Omar, nodded, and turned to hold Khaled's hand  "Let us pray we make this together safely."

"Us too?" Aya was already holding her father's hand, but she stretched her other towards Rasha.

"Of course my dear," She replied assuredly, taking the dirty fingers. "We will all make it through this together."
