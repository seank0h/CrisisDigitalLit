“We’re stuck!” someone yelled. “They took all of our money, our papers! There is nothing here!” Everyone turned their eyes away from the pacing man. It was cold. The wind tore through the hut and made the flames dance. The smoke was revolting, impossible to breath, but the being close to the fire was the only way to stay warm. Someone in the back started a coughing fit. Rasha looked around. So many children. Who was going to take care of all of them? She saw a group of five laying under the same blanket, the ones on the edges pouring out on the sides. Word had spread the government is actively blocking efforts from humanitarian groups, Serbia won’t become a rest stop for the caravans. An older woman tells Khaled that many of the people here used to live in warehouses farther away, but that they were demolished by a bulldozer. Someone throws more trash on the fire, it smells like plastic. Earlier they ate soup from a truck. It tasted bitter, but it was warm, and everyone got a bowl. Only one bowl though, and the truck only comes once a day. Some of the others went off to find food hours ago, they haven’t come back. “Hungary and their fucking wall!” The man shouts. Omar looks up. The man’s jacket is torn, his face is bruised. His footsteps make uneven sounds, he walks with a limp. He slows down, his ranting narrows into mumbling, then into a sob. He sits with his head in his hands. “What are we going to do?” He says to no one.
