Khaled met a girl with the quiet sting of sea spray in his eyes and the shiver of his mother where she was packed tight against his arm. She had mischievous dark eyes in the faint overhead moon, and even with the suffocating fear filling the boat she was smiling. 
They try it for a bit once their feet touch land once more. Omar talks to her mother in absence of a male figure to negotiate on her behalf, and they go to a Spanish coffee shop where the woman at the front narrows her eyes but does not curse. She is polite.
The streets here are old in a different way than in Syria. In Syria, there had been a tangle of old and new construction. Part mosques, part apartments, part shops all fighting stacked end-over-end for every inch of street space; father's show ringing with laughter. In Spain, the buildings have small decoration at the corners the streets tangle in a different meandering sense. They both love how the coffee shop opens; how the air feels like safety. 
Khaled knows his father has applied for a refugee visa in several European countries, but a part of him wants to follow her to her brother in France. They hug when she leaves, tears at the corner of both of their eyes, mother standing firm behind him.
He stays, of course, for duty and responsibility.
